# Khronosophy Scheduling

## Model Structure
`User`s have a `Calendar` and a `Taskboard`.  
`Taskboard`s consist of `Task`s; `Calendar`s consist of `IEvent`s.  
`IEvent`s can be `StaticEvent`s or `ScheduledEvent`s.  
`StaticEvent`s are set manually and cannot be rescheduled.  
`ScheduledEvent`s are generated by Scheduling algorithms from the `Task`s
in the `User`'s `Taskboard`.  

A `Task` is marked as scheduled if it existed before the Scheduling
algorithm was run.  
A `User` can unschedule all tasks. This will remove all `ScheduledEvent`s
from the `User`'s `Calendar` and mark all `Tasks` in the `User`'s
`Taskboard` as unscheduled.
